# Blog Image Generation Task Report

## Task Overview
Generate images for blog posts from `brush-club-seo-blogs.txt` using OpenAI GPT API and organize them in the project structure.

## Current Status: **BLOCKED**

### Issue
The required file `brush-club-seo-blogs.txt` is not present in the workspace. According to the task instructions, this file should contain:
- Multiple blog posts
- Each blog with an "Image prompt:" line describing the image to generate

### Expected File Location
- Original instruction path: `brush-club-website/brush-club-seo-blogs.txt`
- Current workspace path: `./brush-club-seo-blogs.txt` (root directory)

## Planned Implementation (Ready to Execute)

### Step 1: File Analysis
Once the file is available, the implementation will:
1. Parse each blog post in the file
2. Extract blog titles for filename generation
3. Extract "Image prompt:" lines for image generation

### Step 2: Directory Setup
Create the required directory structure:
```
/public/blog_images/
```

### Step 3: Image Generation Process
For each blog post:
1. Extract the image prompt text
2. Generate image using OpenAI DALL-E API with provided key
3. Save image as: `/public/blog_images/slugified-blog-title.png`
4. Replace "Image prompt:" line with "image path: /blog_images/slugified-blog-title.png"

### Step 4: File Updates
Update the original `brush-club-seo-blogs.txt` file with all image path references.

## API Configuration
- **API Key Available**: âœ… (Provided in task instructions)
- **Service**: OpenAI DALL-E Image Generation
- **Output Format**: PNG images
- **Naming Convention**: Slugified blog titles

## Technical Implementation Ready

### Required Dependencies
The implementation will need:
- HTTP client for OpenAI API calls
- File system operations for image saving
- Text processing for slug generation
- File parsing for blog content extraction

### Code Structure
```python
# Pseudo-code implementation ready:
1. parse_blog_file() -> extract titles and prompts
2. generate_images() -> call OpenAI API for each prompt
3. save_images() -> store in /public/blog_images/
4. update_blog_file() -> replace prompts with paths
```

## Next Steps Required
1. **Provide the `brush-club-seo-blogs.txt` file** in the workspace root
2. The automated image generation process will then execute immediately
3. All images will be generated and file paths updated automatically

## Expected Output
- New directory: `/public/blog_images/` with generated PNG files
- Updated `brush-club-seo-blogs.txt` with image path references
- Complete audit log of all generated images and their mappings

**Status**: Ready to proceed once source file is available
**Estimated Completion Time**: 5-10 minutes after file provision (depending on number of blogs)
